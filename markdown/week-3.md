## Reading Recap

### Nicole Fenton - Words as Material
- Writing and its importance
- Communication and problem-solving
- How does this apply to code?

---

## Review
- [John Kuiphoff's Drawing Shapes](http://coursescript.com/notes/interactivecomputing/drawing/index.html)
- [John Kuiphoff's Intro to Animation](http://coursescript.com/notes/interactivecomputing/animation/index.html)

~~~

### Key Takeaways
- Types of shapes
- Color
- Transforming the drawing matrix (push, pop)
- Rotation, Translation
- The "stack", state machines

~~~

### And more
- Animation (frame by frame)
- Variables and state
- Conditionals

## Bringing concepts together so far

[A basic clock](http://codepen.io/grayfuse/full/PPWWzm/) - [Code](http://codepen.io/grayfuse/pen/PPWWzm)

~~~

## Building Blocks
- Fill, Stroke, Color
- Variables to store state, save things
- Let's talk about scope
- Conditionals for displaying content
- Push/Pop and the stack
- A new event, windowResized()

~~~

## Fill, Stroke, Color
- Utilizing before drawing a shape

~~~

## Variables
- Storing state
- Saving properties
- Modifying properties
- Making code more readable

~~~

## Let's talk about scope
- "That's out of scope."
- Where variables live
- Instantiation vs. Assignment
- A code "block"

~~~

## Conditionals
- Finding the right "ifs"
- ==, >=, <=, <, >, !=
- Uses beyond clever emoticons

~~~

## Push/Pop and the stack
- The friendly cafeteria spring-loaded plate stack
- Changing state until you need to change it again

~~~

## A new event, windowResized()
- Allows your sketch to adapt to changing the browser's size (if used with your functions/Variables)
- Important events are often the ones hiding in plain sight

## This Week's Assignment

~~~

A clock that solves a problem
- Use the hour(), minute(), second(), millis() functions 
- Use conditionals to alter appearance, interaction
- Try investigating new events (keyPressed, touch)
