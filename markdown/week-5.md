~~~

### Build a tool for your classmate
- Three Parts
- Your Request (given to the person to your left)
- Your Solution (given back to the person to your right)
- Demonstration of your classmate's tool in action (using automation/repetition) as codepen link

~~~

## 1. Request
- Jot down the name of the person to your left. You will be giving them a request.
- Request takes the same form as a reference page from p5.
- You need to be able to pass it at least one argument, and it is optional if it returns you something (otherwise it should make noise or draw something)

~~~

## 2. Solution
- After receiving the request, create a function and a sample of its use as a codepen link.
- Deliver to classmate.
- Work with them in #3.

~~~

## 3. Demonstration
- Create an example of its use with repetition involved (hint, its useful in altering the arguments passed into the function)
- You shouldn't need to know what is inside the function or alter the function to use it!
