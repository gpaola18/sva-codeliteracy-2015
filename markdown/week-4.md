### Design I/O, Connected Worlds

---

## Tools, Automation, Mass Production
- What defines a tool?
- What are the building blocks for automation?
- What is the purpose?

---

## In Depth
- Arrays
- Looping
- Making Functions

~~~

## Arrays
- Storage Containers
- Indexed
- Think one-row egg cartons

~~~

## Looping
- Allows us to repeat a task
- Gives us a way to iterate over elements in an array
- Extends our ability to work with variable sized data
- Steps towards automation

~~~

## Making Functions
- Encapsulation
- D.R.Y. (don't repeat yourself)
- Single Responsibilty Principle
- Inputs (arguments) and Outputs (return)

## This Week's Assignment

~~~

### Build a tool for your classmate
- Three Parts
- Your Request (given to the person to your left)
- Your Solution (given back to the person to your right)
- Demonstration of your classmate's tool in action (using automation/repetition) as codepen link

~~~

## 1. Request
- Jot down the name of the person to your left. You will be giving them a request.
- Request takes the same form as a reference page from p5.
- You need to be able to pass it at least one argument, and it is optional if it returns you something (otherwise it should make noise or draw something)

~~~

## 2. Solution
- After receiving the request, create a function and a sample of its use as a codepen link.
- Deliver to classmate.
- Work with them in #3.

~~~

## 3. Demonstration
- Create an example of its use with repetition involved (hint, its useful in altering the arguments passed into the function)
- You shouldn't need to know what is inside the function or alter the function to use it!

~~~

Email Codepen URLs to Uijun, and myself.
