### The Logic of Interaction, Fall, 2015

## Overview

In this class, students explore the growing landscape of computational media. As humans' means to interact with each other has expanded through the use and proliferation of computers, a new literacy in code is vital towards understanding and making malleable our digital surroundings. Students are introduced to principles and processes that outline how code is used to connect human beings together, tell stories, facilitate exploration, and guide experiences. They are challenged to engage in a new language, one native to that of a computer, and given guidance towards understanding how the nanosecond precision of a micro-processor can extend their abilities and toolsets as designers and storytellers. Students are presented the core concepts and structures to computation, and further challenged in crafting these skills into mechanisms for creating engaging and dynamic experiences.

## Class By Class

We'll explore code in a variety of ways throughout the course of the semester.

- **Group Research Findings** - Small groups report in on the topics (languages, libraries, real-world applications)
- **Theory Hunting** - We explore the use of code throughout various industries loosely coupled to our topic of the day.
- **Workshop** - We dive in on a new code concept, provide areas for weekly online exploration.

Each class, you will have the following responsibilities.

- Have uploaded some code experiments or exercises, online (based on the week).
- Completed the assigned readings for the week.
- If your small group is assigned, have prepared with your group a small presentation to present at the start of class.
- Midterm and Final projects will give additional opportunities to students, for expanding upon research into practical applications.
